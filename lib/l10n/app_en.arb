    "whatIsToneDexDescription": "ToneDex is an app that helps instrumentalists analyze and compare the tonal quality of their instrument objectively using audio parameters.",
    "howToUse": "How to use",
    "howToUseDescription": "Press the recording button and play a note. Recording will stop automatically after 5 seconds. You can record multiple times to compare different settings. Files are saved in the app and can be played, renamed, analyzed, or deleted.",
    "analysisParameters": "Analysis Parameters",
    "analysisParametersDescription": "The following 5 parameters are analyzed:\n\n• RMS: Energy or loudness of the sound.\n• ZCR: Zero-crossing rate, related to noise or attack.\n• Spectral Centroid: Indicates brightness or sharpness.\n• Bandwidth: Shows the spread of frequencies.\n• Brightness: High-frequency ratio (0.0–1.0 scale).",
    "aboutZScore": "About Z-Score",
    "aboutZScoreDescription": "Each parameter is standardized (mean = 0, std dev = 1) using Z-scores for comparison:\n\nZ ≈ 0 → Average\nZ ≈ ±1 → Slightly high/low\nZ ≥ ±2 → Significantly different",
    "notes": "Notes",
    "notesDescription": "If RMS is too high or low, other values may be affected. Be careful comparing files with very different volume levels. Symmetry is experimental and should be interpreted with other parameters.",
